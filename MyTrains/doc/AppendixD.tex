\chapter{List of Common Configuration Variables}

The NMRA Standard ``Configuration Variables For Digital Command Control" provides descriptions for Digital Decoder Configuration Variables (CVs). CVs allow the decoder to be customized for each locomotive, or other mobile or stationary devices. Unless otherwise specified, configuration Variables shall be stored in non-volatile memory and must not change when power is removed from the decoder over long extended periods of time. CVs defined by the NMRA are marked below as Mandatory, Recommended or Optional. CVs identified as Mandatory must be implemented in order to conform to the Standard, while those marked as Recommended are strongly encouraged but not mandatory, and those marked Optional are at the manufacturerâ€™s discretion. CVs marked as Read-Only indicates a CV whose value should be set by the manufacturer and which the user cannot modify. Many CVs are implementation specific and no uniform specification is required. Others must be implemented in a uniform fashion in order to achieve compatibility. A CV marked as Uniform Spec indicates a CV which requires implementation by manufacturers according to a common specification. CVs marked as Dynamic are used for Unsolicited Decoder Initiated Transmission.

\underline{CV} & \underline{Name} &  \underline{Description} & \underline{Range} & \underline{Default}\\
\\
1 & Primary Address & NMRA: Mandatory, Uniform Spec. & 1 - 127  & 3\\
\\
& & Bits 0-6 contain an address with a value between 1 and 127. Bit seven must have a value of 0. If the value of CV1 is 0 then the decoder will go out of NMRA digital mode and convert to the alternate power source as defined by CV12. This setting will not affect the Digital Decoder's ability to respond to service mode packets. The default value for this CV is 3, if the decoder is not installed in a locomotive or other unit when shipped from the manufacturer.\\
\\
& & ESU:\\
\\
& & For Multiprotocol decoders: Range 1-255 for Motorola. \\
\\
2 & Vstart & NMRA: Required  & 0 - 255  &\\
\\
& & Vstart is used to define the voltage drive level used as the start voltage on the motor. The voltage drive levels shall correspond linearly to the voltage applied to the motor at speed step one, as a fraction of available rectified supply voltage. When the voltage drive level is equal to zero, there shall be zero voltage applied to the motor. When it is at maximum, 255, the full available rectified voltage shall be applied.\\
\\
3 & Acceleration Rate & NMRA: Required & 0 - 255\\
& & Determines the decoder's acceleration rate. The formula for the acceleration rate shall be equal to (the contents of CV3 $\times$ 0.896) / (number of speed steps in use). For example, if the contents of CV3 equals 2, then the acceleration is 0.064 sec/step for a decoder currently using 28 speed steps. If the content of this parameter equals 0 then there is no programmed momentum during acceleration.\\
\\
& & ESU:\\
\\
& & This value multiplied by 0.25 is the time from stop to maximum speed. For LokSound 5 DCC the unit is 0.896 seconds & & \\
\\
4 & Deceleration Rate & NMRA: Required & 0 - 255 & \\
& & Determines a decoders braking rate, in the same fashion as CV3.\\
\\
& & ESU:\\
\\
& & This value multiplied by 0.25 is the time from maximum speed to stop. For LokSound 5 DCC: The unit is 0.896 seconds.  & &\\
\\
5 & Vhigh & NMRA: Optional & 0 - 255 & \\
\\
& & Vhigh is used to specify the motor voltage drive levels at the maximum speed step. This value shall be specified as a fraction of available rectified supply voltage. When the contents of CV5 equals 255, the full available rectified voltage shall be applied. Values of 0 or 1 shall indicate that Vhigh is not used in the calculation of the speed table.\\

\\
6 & VMid & NMRA: Optional & \\
\\
& & Vmid specifies the voltage drive level at the middle speed step. Vmid is used to generate a performance curve in the decoder that translate speed step values into motor voltage drive levels and is specified as a fraction of available rectified supply voltage. Values of 0 or 1 shall indicate that Vmid is not used in the calculation of the speed table.\\

& & ESU: Writing value 8 in this CV triggers a reset to factory default values & 151 & -\\
\\
9 & Total PWM Period & NMRA: Optional\\
& & The value of CV9 sets the nominal PWM period at the decoder output and therefore the frequency is proportional to the reciprocal of the value. The recommend formula for PWM period should be: PWM period (uS) = (131 + MANTISSA $\times$ 4) $\times$ 2 EXP ,Where MANTISSA is in bits 0-4 bits of CV9 (low order) and EXP is bits 5-7 for CV9. If the value programmed into CV9 falls outside a decoder's capability, it is suggested (but not required) that the decoder ``adjust" the value to the appropriate highest or lowest setting supported by the decoder.\\
\\
& & ESU: Motor PWM frequency as a multiple of 1000 Hz. & 10 - 50 & 40\\
\\
10 & EMF Feedback Cutout & NMRA: Optional\\
& & Contains a value between 1 and 128 that indicates the speed step above which the back EMF motor control cuts off. When 14 or 28 speed steps are used the LSB's of the value are truncated appropriately.\\
\\
11 & Packet time-out Value & NMRA: Required\\
& & Contains the maximum time period that the decoder will maintain its speed without receiving a valid packet.\\
\\
12 & Power Source Conversion & NMRA: Optional, Uniform Spec.\\

13 & Alternate Mode Function Status & NMRA: Optional, Uniform Spec.\\
& & Indicates the status of each function (F1 through F8) when the unit is operating in alternate power mode, which cannot control the functions.

\\
15 \& 16 & Decoder Lock & NMRA: Optional, Uniform Spec.\\
\\
& & The Decoder Lock is used to change CVs in only one of several decoders with the same short address (CV1) or long address (CV17 and CV18) that are installed in the same locomotive. Assign a number to CV16 in each decoder (i.e. 1 to motor decoder, 2 to sound decoder, 3 or higher to other decoders) before the decoders are installed in the locomotive. To change a value in another CV of one of the installed decoders, first write the number 1 (motor), 2 (sound), or 3 or higher (other) into CV15, then send the new value to the CV to be changed. The decoders will compare CV15 to CV16 and, if the values are equal, the CV to be changed will be changed. If the values in CV15 and CV16 are different, the update will be ignored.\\
\\
17 \& 18 & Extended Address & NMRA: Optional, Uniform Spec.\\
& & The Extended Address is the locomotives address when the decoder is set up for extended addressing (indicated by a value of 1 in bit  5 of CV29). CV17 contains the most significant bits of the two byte address and must have a value between 0b11000000 and 0b11100111, inclusive, in order for this two byte address to be valid.

This is a 7 bit value (bits 0-6) with bit 7 being reserved for a sign bit (0-add, 1-subtract). In case of overflow the maximum acceleration rate shall be used.

A value between 128 and 154 defines the 28-speed step position (1-26) which will define where the mid range decoder speed value will be applied. In 14-speed mode the decoder will utilize this value divided by two If the value in this variable is outside the range, the default mid cab speed of 14 (for 28 speed mode or 7 for 14 speed mode) shall be used as the mid speed value.
