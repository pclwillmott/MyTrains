\section{Overview}

Loconet is a peer to peer distributed network system on which all devices can monitor the network data flow. The network is event driven by different devices in time, and is not polled by a centralised controller in normal operation. The normal the network state is idle, with no data traffic unless a device has information to send. With no traffic flow, the network is quiet.

The network data is sent in asynchronous format using 1 start bit, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit. The 8 bit data is transmitted least significant bit first. The bit times are 60.0 $\mu$S or 16,660 baud +/- 1.5\%. A computer can connect to a Digitrax USB interface at higher baud rates and the device will make the necessary conversion. Bytes may be transmitted back-to-back, with a start bit immediately following the stop bit of the previous character. 

Any message that has format or framing errors, data errors or is a fragment caused by noise glitches and does not completely follow the message format will be ignored by all receivers, and a new opcode will be scanned for re-synchronisation.

The OPC\_BUSY opcode is included to allow the master to keep the network active whilst it is performing a task that requires a response, and entails a significant processing delay, i.e. it can ensure no new requests are started until it has responded to the last message. This OPC\_BUSY opcode should be simply stripped and ignored.

If a device disconnects from the network and so does not access or reference a slot within the system purge time, the command station will force the un-accessed slot to common status so other system devices can use the slot. The typical purge time of a command station is about 200 seconds. A good ``ping" or slot update activity is about every 100 seconds, i.e. if a user makes no change to a throttle/slot within 100 seconds, the throttle/device should automatically send another speed update at the current speed to reset the purge timeout for that slot.

\section{Message Format}

All the network communications are via multi-byte messages. The command station is defined as the device that is maintaining the refresh stack for DCC packet generation and is actively generating the DCC track data. Refresh of information is typically only performed for mobile decoders. Stationary type decoders are not refreshed and individual immediate commands are sent out to the track as requested.

The command station is only privileged in respect to performing the task of maintaining the locomotive refresh stack and generating DCC packets. In this way other network transactions may occur that the command station does not need to be involved with or understand, as long as they follow the message protocol and timing requirements. i.e. other devices may have a dialog on the network without disturbing or involving the command station. Devices on the network monitor the messages, check for format and data integrity and parse good messages to decode if action is required in the context. Devices such as throttles, input sensors, computer interfaces and control panels may generate the network messages without needing prompting or polling by a central controller.

Devices frequently will be added and removed from an operating the network. The devices and protocol are tolerant of electrical and data transients. The format chosen gives a good degree of data integrity, guaranteed quick network-state synchronisation, high data throughput, good distribution of access to many competing devices and low event latency. Also, the devices may be operated without need for unique ID or other requirements that can make network administration awkward.

The data bytes on the Network are defined as 8 bit data with the most significant bit as an opcode flag bit. If the most significant bit, d7, is 1 then the 7 least significant bits are interpreted as a network opcode . The opcode byte may only occur once in a valid message and is the first byte of a message. All the remaining bytes in the message must have a most significant bit of 0, including the last checksum byte. The checksum is the 1's complement of the byte wise exclusive or of all the bytes in the message, except the checksum itself. To validate data accuracy, all the bytes in a correctly formatted message are exclusive or'ed. If this resulting byte value is 0xFF, then the message data is accepted as good.

The opcodes may be examined to determine message length and if subsequent response message is required. Data bits d6 and d5 encode the message length. The message length includes the opcode and the checksum bytes. The bit d3 = 1 implies that a follow-on message or reply is expected.

\end{tabular}

The A,B,C,D,E are bits available to encode 32 opcodes per message length.

\section{Refresh Slots}
The command station standard refresh stack is an array of up to 120 read/write refresh slots. The slot address is a principal component and is generally the second byte or 1st argument of a message to the master. The standard refresh slot contains up to 10 data bytes relating to a locomotive and also controls a task in the track DCC refresh stack. Most mobile decoder or locomotive operations process the slot associated with the locomotive to be controlled. The slot number is a similar shorthand ID\# to a file handle. Slot addresses 120-127 are reserved for system and command station control. Slot \#124 (0x7C) is allocated for read/write access to the programming track, and the format is not the same as a standard slot. The DCS240 command station has 400 read/write refresh slots. The additional slots in excess of the 120 standard slots are accessed by using extended opcodes. The DCS210 also supports the extended opcodes though it only has 100 refresh slots.

\section{Standard Address Selection}

To request a mobile or locomotive decoder task in the refresh stack, a throttle device requests a locomotive address for use (OPC\_LOCO\_ADR). The command station responds with a slot data read for the slot (OPC\_SL\_RD\_DATA), that contains this locomotive address and all of its state information. If the address is currently not in any slot, the command station will load this new locomotive address into a new slot (speed=0, direction forwards, functions off and 128 step mode) and return this as a OPC\_SL\_RD\_DATA. If no inactive slots are free to load the new locomotive address, the response will be the OPC\_LONG\_ACK with a fail code 0x00.

The throttle/computer must then examine the slot data bytes to work out how to process the command station response. If the slot status 1 byte shows the slot to be common idle or new the throttle may change the slot to in use by performing a null move instruction (see OPC\_MOVE\_SLOTS) on this slot. This activation mechanism is used to guarantee proper slot usage interlocking in a multi-user asynchronous environment.

If the slot return information shows the locomotive requested is in use or up-consisted (i.e. the SL\_CONUP, bit 6 of slot status 1 = 1) the user should not use the slot. Any up-consisted locomotives must be unlinked before usage. Always process the result from the OPC\_LINK\_SLOTS and OPC\_UNLINK\_SLOTS commands, since the command station reserves the right to change the reply slot number and can reject the linking tasks under several circumstances. Verify the reply slot number and the link UP/DN bits in slot status 1 are as you expected.

The throttle will then be able to update speed, direction and function information. Whenever slot information is changed in an active slot , the slot is flagged to be updated as the next DCC packet sent to the track. If the slot is part of linked consist slots the whole consist chain is updated consecutively.

If a throttle is disconnected from the the Network, upon reconnection (if the throttle retains the slot state from before disconnection) it will request the full status of the slot it was previously using. If the reported status and speed, function data etc., from the command station exactly matches the remembered slot state the throttle will continue using the slot. If the slot data does not match, the throttle will assume the slot was purged free by the system and will go through the setup log on procedure again.

With this procedure the throttle does not need to have a unique ID number. slot addresses do not imply they contain any particular locomotive address. The system can be mapped such that the slot address matches the locomotive address within, if the user directly reads and writes to slots without using the command station to allocate locomotive addresses.
